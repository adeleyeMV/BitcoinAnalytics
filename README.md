**Deep Dive into Bitcoin: A Five-Year Analysis Using ETL Methodology**
Bitcoin, as a revolutionary innovation in the world of digital finance, has captured global attention since its inception in 2009. In an effort to comprehend the journey and pricing dynamics of Bitcoin over the past ten years, spanning from September 8, 2013, to September 8, 2023, we present an in-depth analysis. The chosen analytical methodology is ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to unearth deeper insights into this cryptocurrency asset. We will explore several intriguing aspects, including examining the price trends of Bitcoin over time, employing candlestick analysis for detailed visual insights, analyzing close prices using a logarithmic scale, dissecting close price changes on a Y (yearly), M (monthly), and Q (quarterly) basis, and detailing the daily close price fluctuations. Through this analysis, we aim to gain a more profound understanding of how Bitcoin has evolved and how it may influence its future trajectory.
